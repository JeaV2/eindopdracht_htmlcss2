            Noita is a magical action rogue-lite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated. <br> 
            Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've collected and combined however you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            Noita is inspired by underground classics such as Liero, falling sand games, and modern roguelike-likes, -lites and -lite-like-lites.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game was developed by the creators of "Crayon Physics Deluxe", "The Swapper", "Environmental Station Alpha", and "Baba Is You". <br>
            Noita uses Nolla Games' in-house "Falling Everything" game-engine.
        </p>

        <p>
            Noita was first available in early access on 24 September 2019, with the full 1.0 version released on 15 October 2020, and there have been many subsequent patches that have added content and fixes. <br>
            It is available on PCs and Steam Deck.
